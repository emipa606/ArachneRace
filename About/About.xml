1.1 note:
Arachne 1.1 is a temporary update for Arachne since I am slow to release the overhaul Arachne I'm working on.
Thus the graphic update included in 1.1 doesn't make sense (they have human legs on graphic but not in game) because they're graphics for the overhaul. I decided to put it in as a bonus, including 3 new apparel.
Legacy apparel (battle and assassin armor) + the new Valkyrie armor is not going to be included in the overhaul, since i have them made already, it got pushed with the update.

Faction reverted to vanilla, so they should behave more like vanilla now. But due to major changes of PawnKinds and Factions (and hediff for regen), 

Not compatible with 1.0 savefile, not compatible with other mod that patched compatibility into 1.0 arachne old value, do tell the mod author if their compatibility patch show error.
Overhaul version is TBA.

1.1 OPTIONAL:
1.1 version requires [O21] Toolbox for regen to work, can be run without the toolbox if you dont want regen
Regen have 1 flat stage, and it heals and regrows limb
The regen wont show at colonist selection before landing, only after they land

1.1 Compatibility:
Blood and Stains compatible, Do note that if you use regen, there is no bloodpool, regen bandaged bleeding as soon as pawn bleed, so essentialy, arachne do not bleed = no bloodpool. Only footprint available.
Blood and Stains footprint patched for: equium, syntho, mantis, human, arachne, vomit filth, animal filth etc

1.0 :
Adds a playable Arachne race

REQUIRES HUMANOID ALIEN RACES 2.0 INSTALLED AND ACTIVATED BEFORE THIS MOD

Centuries ago, alien spacecraft crashlanded on Arachne homeworld. The Arachne saw the potential of space travel to expand their colony to outer space.
Arachne's technology advanced few hundred years from researching the alien spacecraft artifacts!
Now, they officially launched few dozen colony ship with you as part of the dozens colony ship.
The mission? Establish a colony. Expand. Conquer.

Some Arachne lost their minds being stuck in ships for too long, they have forgotten their mission and they have form their own militia faction.
Beware, they will come, they will attack you...

+ Good with animal
+ Less toxic sensitive
+ Cold tolerance (min temp -8c)
+ Arachne get small bonusses to melee combat stat
+ 2 stage of heal regen - Weak: can recover from bleeding - Strong: can regrow limb

- Bad with plants
- Bad with social
- Psychic sensitive
- Heat sensitive (max temp 18c)

KNOWN ISSUE
- Very rarely theres a graphical bug on dead or down arachne, body detach from spider body or both the detach body spinning independently. I've only seen this happen twice.
- Traps gender - Its not supposed to spawn male arachne, but it may happen, and if it did, Grats! You got yourself traps.
